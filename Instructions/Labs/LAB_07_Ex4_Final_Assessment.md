# Lab 7 - Exercise 4 – Final Assessment

In this exercise, you will continue in your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Messaging Administrator. You have been tasked with resolving a messaging issue in Adatum’s newly configured hybrid deployment.

You should use all the skills you have learned during this course to identify the issue and mitigate the following problem that Adatum is currently experiencing:

**Problem:** In your role as Adatum’s Messaging Administrator, you have completed Adatum’s hybrid Exchange deployment. However, several Adatum users have just informed you that emails are being delivered to their Junk Email folder rather than their Inbox. In fact, your CTO (Alex Wilber) is one of those users; he just stopped by your office to let you know that he did not receive an expected email from Allan Yoo, only to find out later that the email had been delivered to his Junk Email folder. This has added additional urgency to the problem.

The CTO wants you to figure out why emails are not being delivered properly. Use the tools in your environment to solve the issue.

**Hint:** Review the information in this course relating to message delivery. Compare that to what you did in the previous labs when you configured Adatum’s hybrid deployment to determine what needs to be fixed to solve this problem. Once you think you have solved the problem, send an email from Beth Burke’s on-premises mailbox to Alex Wilber’s Microsoft 365 mailbox to see whether the email is treated as spam and delivered into Alex’s Junk Email folder, or if it gets delivered into his Inbox.

**Solution Guide:** If you find yourself struggling with this problem and unable to determine how to resolve it, you can download the [step-by-step solution guide for this Final Assessment lab](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/MS-203T00-Microsoft-365-Messaging/blob/master/Allfiles/MS-203T00-Lab07-Ex4-Final%20Assessment%20Solution%20Guide.pdf). **However, in the spirit of learning, please try to resolve the issue on your own using the knowledge you have acquired in this course before turning to the solution guide.**

**Reminder:** Once you have finished with this lab, you should return to the previous lab exercise and complete Task 3, which tests whether the mailbox migration of Allan Yoo’s on-premises mailbox to Microsoft 365 was successful.
